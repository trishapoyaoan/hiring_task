# Evaluate Sample Responses


**Scenario 1**

 - Timeliness
      - *N/A*
 - Salutation (3)
      - *The email begins with "Thank you for reaching out to us" which is great. However, there is no direct greeting such as Hi (Name) or Dear (Name) to make it more personal.*
 - Acknowledgement (5)
      - *The email starts with acknowledging the sender's concern which is great.*

 - Concise & Relevant Information (5)
      - *The email is clear and provides concise information, outlining the process and explaining our policy.*

 - Tone and Professionalism (4)
      - *The tone is professional and neutral. It is direct to the point and conveys the neccessary information but it could've been addressed more softly. The wording "We regret to hear..." might come a bit strict. A slight adjustment in the wording could make it sound more supportive.*

 - Proofread (5)
      - *There are no obvious grammar or spelling mistakes in the email which is good.*

 - Actionable Next Steps (5)
      - *The email outlines the next steps clearly, letting the student know that the extension is automatic.*

 - Closing Spiel (1)
      - *There is no closing line. Sender should've thanked or added "Please let us know if you have further questions" to encourage additional interaction if needed.*

**Overall Assessment**

- The email is informative, clear, and was able to address the concern of the student. It mantains professional tone and didn't any unnecessary terms. However, they could've added closing spiels to initiate further connection.

  - *The message is relatively clear and provides relevant information about the concern.*
- Tone and Professionalism (3)
