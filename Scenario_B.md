Hi Mary, 


Thank you for reaching out and informing us about your situation. We completely understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes prevent you from attending a session, and we appreciate your proactive communication.

After reviewing your case, we are happy to grant you an exemption for the January 31st session.

However, please be aware that we are unable to provide multiple exemptions and our policy allows for a maximum of 2 absences throughout the duration of the course.

We hope you understand our Attendance Policy. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact us.


All the best,
