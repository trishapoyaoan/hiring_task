Dear Tom,

Thank you for reaching out to us and sharing your situation. I understand that balancing multiple commitments can be challenging, and I appreciate your communication.

Unfortunately, since you were unable to complete and submit Project 6 by the original deadline, I want to remind you that our policy allows for a 48-hour extension. If that extension is not sufficient, we can offer a one-week extension from the original due date. However, after reviewing your records, it appears that all available extensions have been used.

As a result, we are unable to approve your request for another extension. In line with our policy, this means you may be withdrawn from the program. That said, we do have an alternative: we can transition you to **Observer Status**, which will allow you to continue accessing course materials without the obligation to meet deadlines.

What Observer Status entails:

- Full access to course materials and session recordings.
- No requirement to attend live instructor-led sessions.
- No requirement to submit assignments or meet deadlines.
- Limited access: you will not have access to the Slack announcement or career-center channels.
- You will no longer be able to attend the Emerging Engineers Summit unless you have completed another CodePath course.
- Observer status does not grant eligibility for the certificate of completion.
- We hope you understand that Observer Status is the only accommodation we can provide in this situation. 


If you have any further questions or need clarification, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.




All the best,   
Trisha   
CodePath Support
