Hi Jane,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. I understand that you’re requesting an extension for your Cybersecurity 101 course deadline due to issues with your MacBook.

As per our policy, we typically offer a 48-hour extension. If more time is needed beyond that, we consult with our Programs Team to evaluate the request further.

After reviewing your case with the Programs Team, I’m happy to inform you that we can approve your extension request, as you are still within the 1-week maximum deadline.

However, please note that future requests for extensions will be limited, and multiple exemptions may not be possible. Should this occur again, we may need to withdraw you from the program in accordance with our policy.

I hope this helps clarify things. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. 


All the best,   
Trisha
