Hi Mark,

Thank you for reaching out to us, and I’m sorry to hear that you're having trouble accessing the Zoom link. I'm happy to assist you with this issue.

After reviewing your account, I can confirm that your GitHub name is listed on our Members page, so there should be no issues with accessing the link. However, to help resolve this, let’s try a few troubleshooting steps.

Could you please provide the Attendance URL you’re using, as well as your GitHub account details, so we can double-check everything on our end?

Additionally, I recommend clearing your browser cache and using a different browser or tab. Here are the steps to clear your cache:

**For most browsers:**

1. Open your browser
2. Click the menu (three dots)
3. Select “Clear browsing data”
4. Choose a time range (I recommend "All time")
5. Select the types of data you want to clear
6. Click "Clear data"

**For MacBook users:**

1. Open Finder
2. Select “Go” in the top menu
3. Choose “Go to Folder”
4. Type ~/Library/Caches and press Enter
5. Open the browser cache folders
6. Select the files you want to delete
7. Press Delete
8. Empty the Trash


If the issue persists after trying these steps, please don’t hesitate to reach out again for further assistance. 


All the best,   
Trisha
