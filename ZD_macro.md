Hi Dave, 

Thank you for reaching out and explaining the reason for your potential absence on January 31. We understand that unforeseen situations can arise, and we truly appreciate your proactive communication.

As part of the program's attendance policy, each student is allowed 2 absences without penalty. Unfortunately, I must inform you that your absence on January 31 will count as one of your 3 permitted absences, as we are unable to excuse it.

I'd also like to remind you that exceeding these 2 allowed absences will result in your withdrawal from the program.

To ensure tat you are marked present for a session, students are required to attend the vast majority of the session duration and follow a few guidelines:

- Join at least 5 minutes before the session starts.
- Have a stable internet connection to avoid any disruptions.
- Avoid leaving the session early.
- Keep your camera on and actively participate in breakout sesiions.


We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these policies, as they help maintain a positive and effective learning environment.
 
If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email. 



All the best,  
Trisha

# Explanation

**Opening Paragraph**
  - **Before:** "Thank you for reaching out and informing us about the reason for your possible absence on January 31 session."
  - **After:** "Thank you for reaching out and explaining the reason for your potential absence on January 31."

- **Rationale:** I adjusted the sentenced for clarity and flow. "Explaining" is a bit more formal and direct than "informing yus about the reason." Also, "potential" sounds slightly more than "possible."

**Absence Policy Clarification**
- **Before:** We truly understand that unexpected circumstances can arise that may hinder your ability to attend part or the entire session." 
- **After:** "We understand that unforeseen situations canarise, and we truly appreciate your proactive communication."

- **Rationale:** I simplified the sentend to avoid redundancy.

**Absence and Policy Reminder**
- **Before:** "Therefore, I regret to inform you that we can't excuse your absence from your January 31 session."
- **After:** "Unfortunately, I must inform you that your absence on January 31 will count as one of your 3 permitted absences, as we are unable to excuse it."

- **Rationale:** I replaced "regret to inform you" with "Unfortunately, I must inform you" to make it a bit direct and clear. I also emphasize the 3 permitted absences which is a critical point. 

**Reminder on Absences and Withdrawal
- **Before:** "Let me take this opportunity to remind you that exceeding these 2 allowed absences will result in your withdrawal from the program."
- **After:** I'd also like to remind you that exceeding these 2 allowed absences will result in your withdrawal from the program.

- **Rationale:** I adjusted the first part and remove the less formal phrasing. 

**Attendance Requirements for Presence
- **Before:** "Also, to be marked present for a session, students are required to attend the vast majority of the session duration..."

- **After:** "To ensure tat you are marked present for a session, students are required to attend the vast majority of the session duration and follow a few guidelines:"

- **Rationale:** The sentence was reworded to be more straightforward and to the point. 

**Format and Presentation**
- I added bullet points for clarity and easy reading. 

**Sign-off and Tone**
- **Before:** "Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these policies. We value your commitment to your studies and want to ensure that you have the best possible learning environment."
- **After:** "We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these policies, as they help maintain a positive and effective learning environment."

- **Rationale:** This change makes the sentence more concise and focused, while still expressing appreciation. 


**Closing**
- **Before:** "Let us know if you have any further questions by responding to this email.‚Äù
- **After:** "If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email."

- **Rationale:** It broadens the invitation to include concerns, which might be helpful in they still want to further discuss things. Also, "Feel free to reply" makes it more conversational.
